				<h1>1. The Needle Tree</h1>

					<p>
						There were once two brothers who lived on the edge of a forest.
						The elder brother was very mean to his younger brother and ate up all the food and took all his good clothes. One day, the elder brother went into the forest to find some firewood to sell in the market. 
						As he went around chopping the branches of a tree after tree, he came upon a magical tree.
						The tree said to him, 
						‘Oh kind sir, please do not cut my branches. 
						If you spare me, I will give you my golden apples’.
 						The elder brother agreed but was disappointed with the number apples the tree gave him. Greed overcame him, and he threatened to cut the entire trunk if the tree didn’t give him more apples. 
						The magical tree instead showered upon the elder brother hundreds upon hundreds of tiny needles.
						 The elder brother lay on the ground crying in pain as the sun began to lower down the horizon.
						</p>
					
					<p>
						The younger brother grew worried and went in search of his elder brother. 
						He found him with hundreds of needles on his skin.
 						He rushed to his brother and removed each needle with painstaking love.
					 	After he finished, the elder brother apologised for treating him badly and promised to be better. 
						The tree saw the change in the elder brother’s heart and gave them all the golden apples they could ever need.
					</p>
					<h4><u>Moral Of The Story</u></h4>
					<p>
						It is important to be kind and gracious as it will always be rewarded.

				<h1>2. The Boy Who Cried Wolf</h1>
					<img src="TheBoyWhoCriedWolf.jpg" alt="TheBoyWhoCriedWolf"  height="200px" width="200px">
					<p>
						There was once a boy whose father one day told him that he is old enough to look after the sheep. 
						Every day he had to take the sheep over the grass fields and watch them as they grazed to become strong sheep with thick wool. The boy was unhappy though. 
						He wanted to run and play, not watch the boring sheep.
						So, he decided to have some fun instead. 	
						He cried ‘Wolf! Wolf!’ until the entire village came running with stones to chase away the wolf before it could eat any of the sheep. 
						Once they saw that there was no wolf, they left muttering under their breath about how the boy was wasting their time and giving them a good fright while at it. 
						The next day, the boy again cried ‘Wolf! Wolf!’ and the villagers again rushed to chase the wolf away.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					As the boy laughed at the fright he had caused, the villagers left, some angrier than the others. 
					The third day, as the boy went up a small hill, he suddenly saw a wolf attacking his sheep. 
					He cried as hard as he could, ‘Wolf! Wolf! WOLF!’, but the villagers thought he was trying to fool them again and did not come to rescue the sheep. 
					The little boy lost three sheep that day, all because he cried wolf too many times.
					</p>
					<h4><u>Moral Of The Story</u></h4>
					<p>
						Do not make stories up for attention, for no one will help you when you actually need it.
