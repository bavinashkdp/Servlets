					<h3>The Gingerbread Man </h3>
					<p>
						And every child enjoys it for different reasons 
						– be it travelling to magical worlds, 
						learning new concepts, going on adventures, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						With stories, the possibilities are truly limitless — your child can join Tintin as he travels the world, 
						solves mysteries and nabs crooks; 
						your child can study at Hogwarts and learn about life through the magical world of Harry Potter; 
						your child can go back in time and become an active participant at Akbar’s court.
					</p>
					<p>
						Perhaps the best way to help a child explore, 
						express, understand emotions, problems, problem-solving, habits,
 						and much more is via stories. Be it a quick bedtime tale or a grandma fable, 
						each story helps a child enter a completely different magical and imaginative world that has no boundaries.
